## On Your Own

### 1. Create a sticky header. 
Before scrolling, the full header should be visible, as you scroll, the header will shrink to only show the menu and the button.

### 2. Create a Parallax Banner
Create a scrolling parallax banner. This should be placed under the hero banner and above the horizontal scrolling cards. The parallax banner should scroll on all screens: small to large.
